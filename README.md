Welcome to Word Bank Game! 


In this game, two players will guess from a word bank with a theme by guessing letters.
On each turn, players will be given a **Correct v. Incorrect** word bank
Player 1 will start his/her turn and their turn fully ends when the word is correctly guessed or if they run out of word guesses (Maximum allowed 3)
After that Player 2 will then follow up with his/her turn.
The winner is determined by whoever guesses the word correctly first or whoever has the less amount of letter guesses despite running out of word guesses.

Happy Guessing!

This project was created by Viet Nguyen in collaboration with Jayla Parrot who helped add more unique features to the project. A special shout out to John Avante for giving me plentiful ideas on how to implement this game
